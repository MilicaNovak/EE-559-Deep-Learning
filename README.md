# Deep Learning, 2018

This repository contains the report and proposed solution on associated with the EPFL master course [EE-559 Deep Learning][epfl_link] [materials][material_link]. 
The task of the project was to implement a neural network to predict the laterality of finger movement
(left or right) from the EEG recording. The dataset was used in [BCI Competition II][comptetition] is described in [details][dataset_link].
